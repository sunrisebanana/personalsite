# My Personal Website

This is my personal portfolio website, which contains my resume and some social media links, as well as some other personal projects as I build them.

It was created in Typescript React, using Nextjs for project scaffolding, and semantic-ui-react for the visual components and styling. 

If you would like to check out the UX features I implemented to make this site as usable as possible, 
please check out this website on mobile! Lots of time was spent working around semantic's lack of collapsable navbars, 
and I think I enjoy my solution quite a bit. Additionally, check out my resume, which I created in latex and converted to HTML,
and scroll down on desktop to see how the nicely the Navbar follows!
